// 1. Create a new type: vehicle.
// 		The underlying type is a struct.
// 		The fields:
//			doors
//			color
// 2. Create two new types: truck & sedan.
// 		- The underlying type of each of these new types is a struct.
// 		- Embed the “vehicle” type in both truck & sedan.
// 		- Give truck the field “fourWheel” which will be set to bool.
// 		- Give sedan the field “luxury” which will be set to bool. solution
// 3. Using the vehicle, truck, and sedan structs:
// 		- using a composite literal, create a value of type truck and assign values to the fields;
// 		- using a composite literal, create a value of type sedan and assign values to the fields.
// 4. Print out each of these values.
// 5. Print out a single field from each of these values.
